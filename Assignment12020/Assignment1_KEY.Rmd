## Introduction

This assignment is going to use the principles of energy balance to examine how changing properties of urban environments alter the temperature of urban landscapes. In urban areas, the distribution of materials such as asphalt and concrete has been shown to lead to higher air temperatures compared to rural counterparts. This is known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect. High temperatures can be harmful to the health of residents, and in order to mitigate the UHI cities adopt strategies like increasing tree cover to increase shade and cooling, or increasing the reflectivity, also called albedo, with white paint. However, these strategies are not always evenly distributed throughout a city and may create environmental inequity. Read more about this phenomena [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NUJATMo7KnmC3PpyFRdxo9HWH0F-zQxUDKiIW6pX7pY/edit#heading=h.z1slrwcvefnj).


We've assembled a dataset that captures a snapshot of average midday temperatures in August, the amount of vegetation, and a host of social/economic data across each neighborhood in the county of Los Angeles. The temperature data is from the Landsat satellite’s surface thermal data and was acquired in the Spring (April) and Summer (August) of 2020. The vegetation data is characterized by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and is taken from similar dates. [NDVI](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php) is a measure of “greenness” and higher values of NDVI indicate a greater amount of green vegetation within each neighborhood. The neighborhood information is collated
from the incredibly awesome Mapping LA project developed by the [LA Times](http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods), which is worth checking out. See a description of each column in the dataset at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hh-hMt5RuXA3lBYX8G16T3334zXQfbFnJzCxh3qbDsw/edit?usp=sharing). For a visual reference of the LA times project, here is a map of the area of the LA basin and the neighborhoods.

```

#### Observations 

Lets start by just exploring our data. One of the first things we'd want to explore is what data is there. Run the code below to load the data and output the column names of all the data. 

```{r data_overview, message=F}
# load in data as a CSV 
LA_nbhds <- read.csv("../CPT/data/ESM203_F2020_Ass1.csv")

# output column names
colnames(LA_nbhds)
```

#### Summer NDVI v. surface temperatures

So in our exploration, one of the plots we made was mean August surface temperature against NDVI. We notice that this trend looks somewhat promising, and decide to plot a trend line. Do this by running the chunk below.  

```{r ndvi_plot, message=F}

LA_nbhds %>% 
  dplyr::filter(NDVI_SUMMER > 0 & NDVI_SUMMER < 1) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_jitter(aes(x=NDVI_SUMMER, y=TEMP_SUMMER)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x=NDVI_SUMMER, y=TEMP_SUMMER), method=lm) + 
  labs(x = "August NDVI", y="August Temperature (deg C)") +
  ggtitle("Mean August 2020 surface temperature and NDVI of LA County")

```

##### Answer these questions:

> 6 points 

1. Describe the relationship between August 2020 Mean Temperature and NDVI

> As NDVI increases, temperature decreases. (2)

2. What might be some possible explanations as to why this relationship exists? There's no right answer here, go wild with it. 

> Higher NDVI indicates vegetation. Vegetation provides cooling through evapotranspiration and shade. (2)

3. Now based upon your explanation form a single statement here, which we will use the model to test. This is your hypothesis. There is no "right answer," so please dont go back and change this.

> Vegetation decreases surface temperatures. (2)


### Part II: Understanding the surface energy balance model

We're going be using equations throughout this class, so lets learn how to become more literate in equations. To do this we're going to explain the components and then draw a conceptual model. This may take some time, but its an extremely important skill. So take a deep breath, be patient with yourself, and dive in. 

Here is the somewhat simplified equation we will be using, based off of the equation on page 211 of Chapter 7 in Ecological Climatology by Bonan.


$$(1 - \alpha)S_{\downarrow} + L_{\downarrow} = L_{\uparrow} + H + \lambda E + G$$

##### Answer these questions:

> 10 points 

Define each of the terms of the equation and include one sentence of what the flux is in plain language. If you need a hint, check out the chapter on [Surface Energy Fluxes](https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/courses/pluginfile.php/10694510/mod_resource/content/2/Reading%20for%20Surface%20Energy%20Balance.pdf).


4. $(1 - \alpha)S_{\downarrow}$

> Net shortwave radiation is the incoming shortwave radiation, minus what is reflected back to atmosphere, which depends on albedo of the surface. (1)

5. $L_{\downarrow}$

> incoming longwave radiation - depends on the temperature and emissivity of the atmosphere, and if there are clouds present. (1)

6. $L_{\uparrow}$

> outgoing longwave radiation - depends on the temperature and emissivity of the surface. (1)

7. $H$

> sensible heat - depends on temperature gradient between the surface and air. (1)

8. $\lambda E$

> latent heat - depends on vapor pressure gradient between the surface and air. (1)

9. $G$ We will be ignoring G for this assignment, but still define it

> ground flux - this is the conduction between the surface and deeper layers of the ground, it's a small value compared to others. (1)

10. Now describe the full equation in no more than three sentences

> The surface energy balance combines all the forms of heat transfer at the surface, including radiation, conduction, and convection, and enables us to solve for temperature based on the conditions of the surface and ambient air. (1)


11. Draw a conceptual model of the equation from above, showing each of the fluxes going in and out of the surface. If you're unsure what a conceptual model is please reference the slides or google it, and a hint: you've seen the conceptual model you should be drawing before. 

To insert your conceptual model into this document: create a conceptual model by hand or on the computer and then turn it into a .jpg, or any photo file type. Include that photo in the assignment folder, and then use this code as a template to add it to this document:

### Part III: Solving for surface temperature 

The chunk below consists of functions needed to do the assignment. No need to change or do anything here, just run this chunk so the equations can be used later. 
```{r functions}
# the following functions are needed to solve the surface energy balance and calculate latent heat 

# Tetens eq. to solve for saturated vapor pressure (used in LE eq.)
sat_vp <- function(T){
  e <- 0.61078*exp(17.27*T/(T+237.3))
  return(e)
}

# surface energy balance returns surface temperature
# input is surface temperature, represented as x (in celsius)
# veg represents % veg cover, alpha is albedo, and eps is emissivity 
seb <- function(x, veg=0, alpha=0.15, eps=0.95){ 
  r_w = 1/(veg*50) # scaler for veg 
  L_inc = 0.9*sigma * (T_a+273.15)^4  # incoming longwave radiation [W/m^2]
  R_av = (K_inc*(1-alpha) + L_inc) # net available energy at surface [W/m^2] 
  L_out = eps*sigma*(x+273.15)^4 # outgoing longwave radiation [W/m^2]
  H = 1.15*1005*(x-T_a)/r_H # sensible heat flux [W/m^2]
  E = 1.15*1005/66.5*(sat_vp(x) - sat_vp(T_a))/r_w # latent heat flux [W/m^2]
  val = - R_av + L_out + H + E
  return(val)
}

## returns bar plot of the different fluxes
plot_fluxes <- function(veg_cov){
  alpha=0.2
  range=c(1,100)
  x <- uniroot.all(seb, range, veg=veg_cov, alpha=0.2)
  r_w = 1/(veg_cov*50) # scaler for veg
  L_inc = 0.9*sigma * (T_a+273.15)^4  # incoming longwave radiation [W/m^2]
  R_av = (K_inc*(1-alpha) + L_inc) # net available energy at surface [W/m^2] 
  L_out = eps*sigma*(x+273.15)^4 # outgoing longwave radiation [W/m^2]
  H = 1.15*1005*(x-T_a)/r_H # sensible heat flux [W/m^2]
  E = 1.15*1005/66.5*(sat_vp(x) - sat_vp(T_a))/r_w # latent heat flux [W/m^2]
  fluxes <- data.frame(flux=c("R_av","L_out","H","E"), value=c(R_av,L_out,H,E))
  fluxes$flux <- factor(fluxes$flux, levels=c("R_av", "L_out", "H","E"))
  plot <- ggplot(fluxes) + geom_col(aes(x=flux, y=value, fill=flux)) +
    ylab("energy [W/m^2]")
  return(plot)
}

```

In order to use this equation to test our hypothesis we are going to do a sensitivity analysis. To perform this, we vary one parameter at a time and observe how the output changes, which in this case is temperature. We're first going to do an example together, and then you'll do one on your own.

#### Albedo

We learned in class that albedo affects the amount of shortwave radiation entering the surface by reflecting some back. Albedo affects the available energy at the surface, which we will call $R_{av}$, through the equations:

$$S_{net} = S_{\downarrow}*(1-\alpha)$$ 

$$R_{av} = S_{net} + L_{\downarrow}$$


Where $\alpha$ represents albedo. Use the code below to explore the model outcomes, and to answer the questions below. 

The following are other variables needed to use the model. No need to change these.  
```{r vars}
eps = 0.95 # surface emissivity
T_a = 28 # ambient atm temp in Celsius 
sigma = 5.6704*10^-8 #W/m^2/K^4 stefan-boltzmann constant
r_H = 20 # Sensible heat resistivity
K_inc = 800 # W/m^2, incoming shortwave radiation
```

This chunk runs the model, outputs the steady state temperature, and displays the graph of the sensitivity analysis.
```{r solve}
## Run the below code to solve for surface temperature
# temp_s is surface temperature
range = c(0,100)
test_albedo <- function(x){
  temp_s = uniroot.all(seb, range, alpha=x)
  return(temp_s)
}

# You can solve for surface temp by inputting specific values of albedo, where x is albedo - replace x with any value between 0 and 1. 
test_albedo(x=0.9)

# The code below runs the above function for every value of albedo in the 'alpha' vector below
# quick SA for veg parameter 
alpha <- seq(0,1, by=0.05)
test <- sapply(X=alpha, FUN=test_albedo)
# combine input and output 
albedo_df <- data.frame(alpha, test)
# plot data frame (do this together in discussion)
ggplot(albedo_df) + geom_point(aes(x=alpha, y=test)) + 
  labs(x="albedo", y="surface temperature (deg C)")

```

##### Answer these questions:

> 6 points 

12. What happens to the surface temperature when albedo increases?

> The surface temperature decreases as albedo increases. (2)

13. Think about a roof made of asphalt and a roof that has been painted white. Which would have a higher albedo?

> The white roof would have higher albedo because it's more reflective. (2)

14. Which would have a higher surface temperature?

> The asphalt roof would have a higher surface temperature because it has a lower albedo and will absorb more solar radiation. (2)


#### Vegetation

Now its your turn do a sensitivity analysis based upon the amount of vegetation, but first we dive a little deeper into the latent energy equation. 

Latent energy is a convective flux, which - from lecture - means that its magnitude is proportional to a gradient and inversely proportional to a resistence:

$$\lambda E \propto \frac{\Delta e}{r_W}$$

In reality, as we've seen in the reading, this equation is a bit more complicated. For now, dont get too stuck on this; all of the additional terms are related to converting the mass flux of water implied by a vapor gradient into an energy flux. This energy flux is a bit obscure (it's not called "latent" for nothing), but it is the transport of energy away from the surface when there is net evaporation of water at the surface and then subsequent transport of water vapor from the surface to the atmosphere. We only include it to elaborate on the actual equations you are using and to ensure that the equation is dimensionally correct.

$$\lambda E = -\frac{\rho*C_p}{\gamma}*\frac{e_a - e_{*}[T_s]}{r_W}$$

Where $-\frac{\rho*C_p}{\gamma}$ represents the density of air, $\rho$ (kg/m$^3$), specific heat capacity, $C_p$ (J kg$^{-1}$ $^{\circ}$C$^{-1}$), and the psychrometric constant, $\gamma$ (Pa/$^{\circ}$C). All of these terms are fairly constant, so let's move on to the second group of terms, which vary much more in time and space. 

The numerator of the second part, $(e_a - e_{*}[T_s])$ corresponds to the $\Delta e$ term in the simplified equation above. It represents the gradient between the atmospheric vapor pressure, $e_a$ (Pa), and the surface vapor pressure, $e_{*}[T_s]$ (Pa). This gradient is almost always negative, because moisture in plants and the soil usually keeps the surface vapor pressure higher than the atmosphere. The resistance to vapor transfer between the surface and the atmosphere is $r_W$ (s/m). All things being equal, the resistance to vapor transport, $r_W$, is determined by amount of **vegetation** at the surface. Check out [section 7.2](https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/courses/pluginfile.php/10694510/mod_resource/content/2/Reading%20for%20Surface%20Energy%20Balance.pdf) to learn more.

15. If $r_W$ - the resistence to water vapor transport - is determined by the amount of vegetation, then what time of year might you expect the value of $r_W$ to be largest, and why?

> In southern california, I would expect $r_W$ to be the highest in the summer time because there is little water availabile to the vegetation. Could also argue that in northern or eastern states, $r_W$ would be higher in the winter when trees lose their leaves or grasses are dead. (2)

16. How might the value of $r_W$ change if vegetation became water stressed, and why?

> The value of $r_W$ would increase if vegetation is water stressed, because there is more resistance to transporting water vapor when vegetation close their stomata. (2)

17. Over the course of a day, which value - $e_a$ or $e_{*}[T_s])$ - do you expect to change the most, and why?

> $e_*{T_s}$ because it changes with the temperature. (2)

18. What time of day might you expect the surface water vapor gradient, $(e_a - e_{*}[T_s])$, to be most negative, and why?

> The gradient would be the largest at solar noon when the surface vapor pressure is largest. (2)

19. Suppose for a moment that the vapor pressure gradient became positive, which means that the atmospheric vapor pressure, $e_a$ is greater than the surface vapor pressure, $e_{*}[T_s]$. What do you think would happen to the latent energy flux? How might this condition alter the surface energy balance? Can you think of an example when this condition has probably happened or is happening?

> If the atmospheric vapor pressure is greater than the surface, it would cause latent energy flux to change directions, and condensation would occur at the surface. (2)

For this model, we will use the fraction of vegetation cover, called 'veg', to account for changes in the resistance to water vapor transport when vegetation is present. 

In the same way we did a sensitivity analysis for albedo, this chunk does a sensitivity analysis for vegetation. 
```{r veg_sa, eval=F}
## Run the below code to solve for surface temperature
# temp_s is surface temperature
range = c(0,100)
test_veg <- function(veg){
  temp_s = uniroot.all(seb, range, veg=veg)
  return(temp_s)
}

# quick SA for veg parameter 
veg <- seq(0,1, by=0.05)
test <- sapply(X=veg, FUN=test_veg)
# copy and paste the code from the albedo testing above, then create a plot of veg vs. surface temperature  
veg_df <- data.frame(veg, test)
ggplot(veg_df) + geom_point(aes(x=veg, y=test)) + 
  labs(x="vegetation (%)", y="surface temperature (deg C)")

```


We have created a function that lets you plot the different energy fluxes based on the amount of vegetation. Use this tool to help conceptualize the results of your sensitivity analysis above. You can change the number in `plot_fluxes(veg=#)` to see how different amounts of vegetation affect the different major fluxes of the energy model. Copy and past the line to plot multiples of this plot.

```{r plot}
# plot_fluxes shows a bar plot of the different energy fluxes. Change veg between 0 to 1 to see how the latent and sensible energy change 
plot_fluxes(veg_cov=1)
plot_fluxes(veg_cov=0)

```

> 10 points

20. How does the presence of vegetation affect the modeled surface temperature? 

> Vegetation decreases surface temperature in our model. (2)

21. Explain why this relationship occurs. Think back to the equation we had you describe.

> Vegetation increases the evapotranspiration that occurs because leaves hold water, making the surface saturated, and increasing the VPD. More of the energy at the surface goes towards evapotranspiration and latent heat, instead of sensible heat, leading to cooler surface temps. (2)

22. Does this relationship explain the initial graph between NDVI and temperature above (in the introduction)? Explain. Include a comment about your initial hypothesis as well.

> Yes, more vegetation had on average lower summer temperatures. A comment was made about the initial hypothesis. (2)

23. We've only simulated the vegetation effects on surface temperature through its impact on the resistance to water transport ($r_W$). What other components of energy balance might the presence or absence of vegetation alter? 

> Vegetation affects surface characteristics of albedo and emissivity. Trees affect the net radiation because their canopies absorb more radiation through the different layers, provide shade, and block outgoing longwave. Vegetation could affect ground heat flux, but this is relatively small. (2)

24. You've now explored the relationship between vegetation and temperature as well as albedo and temperature. If someone were to ask you if a green (vegetated) roof or a white roof were better from an energy balance perspective, how might you use this model to answer that question?

> We could vary both vegetation and albedo together. With a white roof, there would be higher albedo and less net available energy at the surface, but no vegetation and no latent energy - so all of the outgoing energy would go towards sensible heat. With a vegetated roof, the albedo will be much lower, so more energy is being absorbed. however, the vegetation will increase latent energy and lower temperatures. An arguement could be made for either roof being cooler. (2)


### Part IV: Connecting to socioeconomic data 

> 8 points

Remember the NDVI. v. temp plot above? Now it's your turn to explore the data set (`LA_nbhds`) and create your own plots. This is your turn to apply what you have learned and get creative. You can use anything you've learned from 206 so far to explore and summarize the data. Create at least one plot that includes NDVI or temperature on the x-axis, and a socio-economic variable on the y-axis. You can copy and paste the code from above, but also be creative! Then answer the reflection questions below. 
```{r socioeconomic}
LA_nbhds %>% 
  dplyr::filter(NDVI_SUMMER > 0 & NDVI_SUMMER < 1) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_jitter(aes(x=NDVI_SUMMER, y=WHITE.POPULATION)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x=NDVI_SUMMER, y=WHITE.POPULATION), method=lm) + 
  labs(x = "August NDVI", y="White Population %") +
  ggtitle("Mean August 2020 NDVI and White Population of LA County neighborhoods")

```

> is the plot clearly labelled? Does it contain title on axis and units? (3)

25. Based on your plot(s) what relationship exists? Write a short (1-2 paragraph max) reaction/response to your findings, focusing on what they imply for issues related to environmental management, planning, and/or environmental justice. While your response should refer to the specifics of your plots/presentation, you do not need to do an exhaustive analysis or find citations to support your inference.

> A paragraph here that describes the above plot, relating environmental justice to urban heat islands. (3)

26. For this entire assignment: Share a thought or lesson that clicked for you. What was the most interesting part?

> Thoughts were shared. (2)
