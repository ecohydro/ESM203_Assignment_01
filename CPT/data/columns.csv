CRIME PER CAPITA,"The rate of violent crimes per 10,000 people varies widely among the more than 200 neighborhoods and cities policed by the LAPD and L.A. County Sheriff's Department. This map and list show the rates from Dec. 30, 2019 to June 28, 2020, the most recent six months for which complete data is available for all areas patrolled by the departments. Violent crime is defined as homicide, rape, aggravated assault and robbery. Bear in mind that in areas with relatively low populations, a small number of crimes can generate a large per capita rate. For that reason, the chart below contains both per capita statistics and gross crime counts."
